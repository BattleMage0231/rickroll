# Rickroll Language Documentation

Rickroll is a dynamically-typed imperative programming language that functions using lyrics from Never Gonna Give You Up as statements.

The recommended order to go through the documentation (which is formatted as a tutorial) is:
1. [Language Basics](basic.md)
2. [Loops and Control Structures](control.md)
3. [Functions](functions.md)
