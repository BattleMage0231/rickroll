# Rickroll Language Documentation

Rickroll is a dynamically-typed imperative programming language that functions using lyrics adapted from Never Gonna Give You Up as commands.

This folder contains exhaustive documentation of the language in its current state.

The recommended order to go through the documentation (which is formatted as a tutorial) is:
1. [Language Basics](basic.md)
2. [Loops and Control Structures](control.md)
3. [Functions](functions.md)
4. [Built-in Functions](builtin_functions.md)
